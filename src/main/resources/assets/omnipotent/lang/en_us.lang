#function description
function.description.counterAttack=If this function is enabled, entities that attack you will suffer an automatic counterattack. The counterattack may vary depending on other options and abilities related to players.
function.description.killAllEntities=This function allows Kaia to kill any type of entity, such as arrows, blocks in the world, falling blocks, or blocks primed for explosions like TNTs and any other entity.
function.description.killFriendEntities=This function allows Kaia to kill neutral or friendly entities such as animals, golems, or villagers.
function.description.attackYourWolf=This function allows Kaia to kill its own wolf. By default, it is disabled.
function.description.interactLiquid=This function allows Kaia to break liquid blocks such as water and lava.
function.description.noBreakTileEntity=This function prevents Kaia from breaking special blocks such as furnaces, chests, machinery, etc. It does so by preserving blocks that would be broken around the specific block being mined.
function.description.autobackpackentities=This function makes Kaia automatically collect drops from killed entities and send them to her backpack.
function.description.chargeEnergyItemsInInventory=This function makes Kaia fully charge any item in her inventory that supports energy.
function.description.summonlightboltsinkill=This function makes Kaia summon multiple colored lightning bolts when entities die around her (not triggered by player deaths).
function.description.autobackpack=This function makes Kaia store drops from any mined block in her backpack.
function.description.playersCantRespawn=With this function enabled, any player killed by Kaia will not be able to respawn.
function.description.banEntitiesAttacked=With this function enabled, any killed entity (including special entities) will be banned and will not be able to naturally respawn in the dimension where it was killed.
function.description.autoKill=This function makes Kaia kill any nearby entity within a certain block radius.
function.description.chargeManaItemsInInventory=This function makes Kaia fully charge the mana of any item in her inventory that supports mana.
function.description.areaBloco=The value of this function cannot be lower than 1. It determines the cubic area that will be mined with a single click. If an even number is used, the value will decrease by 1.
function.description.rangeAttack=The value of this option defines the range of Kaia's attack (5 or less will have no effect).
function.description.maxcountslot=The value of this option determines the maximum quantity of items that can fit in a single slot in Kaia's backpack.
function.description.blockReachDistance=The value of this option defines the mining reach distance of Kaia (default is 5).
function.description.chargeEnergyInBlocksAround=Fully charges the energy of blocks within a certain distance. Set to 0 to disable.
function.description.chargeManaInBlocksAround=Fully charges the mana of blocks within a certain distance. Set to 0 to disable.
function.description.ignoreKeepInventory=With this function enabled, all players killed by Kaia will have their keepinventory setting ignored, causing them to drop their items.
function.description.optionOfColor=The values of this option define the color that will be displayed for the item in the inventory. The options are 1, 2, 3 and 4.
function.description.customPlayerName=This option, when enabled, will display the player's name using special color effects. Other players will be able to see it.
function.description.fastBreakBlocks=This option optimizes block breaking in the area to be faster (some effects such as sounds and breaking animation will not be executed).
function.description.rgbEnchantmentGlitch=This option activates the RGB effect on sword enchantment.
function.description.banEntityToSealedDimension=This option banishes the player killed by Kaia to another dimension. In this dimension, no mobs spawn, portals do not function, all items of the player are deleted, and the respawn occurs within it. If it is a mob, it will not be killed but rather sent to the other dimension.
function.description.maximumObliteration=This option obliterates the entity; it's useful when the entity isn't killed by normal Kaia.
function.description.rescueBeforeDeath=This option makes Kaia return to your inventory just as you're about to die.
function.description.excludeTileEntityDestruction=This option preserves TileEntity blocks from being destroyed during area block mining.
function.description.teleportAllItemsToBackpack=Teleports all items within the defined range directly to Kaia's inventory. The value below is in blocks, and 0 means disabled.
